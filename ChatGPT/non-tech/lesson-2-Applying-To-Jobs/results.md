1. I have a strong interest in large language models due to their potential to revolutionize various aspects of software engineering and development. The ability to leverage AI in creating innovative solutions is particularly intriguing to me.

2. I have been involved in many successful zero to one projects in my professional career. One was at PwC, where I led the development of internal applications from concept to completion. Another was at Boston Tech Insights, where I co-founded a startup focused on leveraging AI for commercial due diligence.

3. What excites me most about AI applications is their capacity to solve complex problems and streamline processes. In the case of Envorso's startup, the opportunity to work on cutting-edge generative AI to modernize software engineering operations is particularly appealing. Being at the forefront of this technology is both exciting and rewarding.

4. To stay current in the rapidly evolving AI space, I regularly engage in self-directed learning, attending conferences, webinars, and workshops. I also follow industry blogs, participate in online forums, and engage with a network of professionals who share insights and updates in the field. I am also recording a short video on how to use ChatGPT to apply for jobs.

5. Aside from the standard two-week notice period, I do not have any obstacles that would prevent me from starting a new role. I am fully prepared to transition smoothly into a new position and contribute effectively to the team.
